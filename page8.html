<p style="color:GhostWhite;">"Wake up little one you're almost there."</p>

<p style="color:GhostWhite;">You open your eyes and see that there is no one around you.<br>
								Instead you're now sitting on an old wooden bench in the middle of a grass field.<br>
								You stand up on the becnh and feel the cool breeze welcome you with a famialr feeling.<br>
								You look around and see a dandelion.</p>
								
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">You jump down from the bench and towards it.<br>
								As you approach it, the wind blows and scatters the dandelion.<br>
								They all appear to be flowing in the same direction.<br>
								With this feeling of familiarity, you choose to follow.</p>
