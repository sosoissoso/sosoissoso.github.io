<p style="color:GhostWhite;">As you stare at the rodent it slowly starts making its way to you.<br>
								First it circles around you and then gets closer to sniff you.</p>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">It looks you up and down again and then down the hole.<br>
								Almost reluctantly the rodent looks back at you and moves infront of you.<br>
								As if it's telling you to climb on.</p>

<a style="color:LightCoral;" href="page5.html">You climb ontop the rodent.</a><br>
