<p style="color:GhostWhite;">You chose not to rest and begin to observe the giants around you.<br>
								"I'll be home soon..."</p>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">"...no I'm tryign to tell you that...".</p>

<p style="color:GhostWhite;">"...yeah yeah and then I told her...".</p>

<p style="color:GhostWhite;">"...I have the rent. Yes I'll be home just after this stop...".</p>

<p style="color:GhostWhite;">"We all live busy lives, but we still try our hardest to have a place to call home at the end of the day.<br>
								Do you have a place to call home little one?"</p>
								
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">You look up to see a giant facing forward smiling.<br>
								She was a giant but smaller compared to the others.<br>
								Unsure if she was even asking the question to you, you nod.</p>
								
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">"That's good. It might be a while until you can get back.<br>
								Rest your little body."</p>
								
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">As if she had put a spell on you, you feel your eyes getting heavier until they're closed shut.</p>
