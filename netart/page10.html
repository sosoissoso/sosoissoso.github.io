<p style="color:GhostWhite;">The dandelions take you through some tall grass, until you reach a cleared out area.<br>
								You see a small stone path made of pebbles leading to some broken bricks leaning on each other.<br>
								You walk on the path and reach an opening that's just the perfect size for you.<br></p>

<p style="color:LightPink;">Ah, this is it. This is why I had that feeling of familiarity.<br>
								I'm home now.</p>
								
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">You've had quiet an adventure litte one.<br>
								Take your time and rest as much as you want.<br>
								You've made it to your place you call home.</p>
								

<a style="color:LightCoral;" href="page11.html">Go inside.</a><br>
