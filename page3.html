<p style="color:GhostWhite;">The rodent stays compeltely still as you approach it.<br>
								You reach your hand out and it hesitantly moves its head closer to your hand.</p>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">You begin to pet the rodent and it seems to love it.<br>
								It looks down the hole and back at you multiple times.<br>
								As if it's telling you to climb on.</p>

<a style="color:LightCoral;" href="page5.html">You climb ontop the rodent.</a><br>
